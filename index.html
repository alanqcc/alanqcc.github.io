About me:
Hello, my name is Qiuyi, but I go by Alan as well. I grew up mostly in New York City, andI attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City, Manhattan. 
My hobbies includes simple sketches/drawing, playing video games, and some painting. When I was younger I was into playing sports and biking.
I also like watching cartoons/TV Shows. Currently I'm on season 5 of Rick and Morty.

My favorite food:
My favorite food is hard to say. I can't really pinpoint a specific food that is my favorite, as it always changes.
However, I know that my favorite foods are always the foods that my mother has made for me. Nothing else really comes close.
The homemade food that my mother makes contains memories and taste, which I value more than any other street food.
